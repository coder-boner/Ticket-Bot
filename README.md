# Ticket-Bot
A bot for tickets, what else will you expect.

You have to set 

TICKET_CATEGORY_ID - This is for active and unclaimed tickets

ARCHIVE_CATEGORY_ID - This is for the deleted/clsoed tickets

SUPPORT_ROLE_ID - Set this to your support roles ID in discord

--------------

DEL_CATEGORY_ID - Put this as your archive category id as it will delete all channels in the category

AUTHORIZED_USER_ID - Set this as your discord id as this is for perms to delete all archived tickets and make more ticket selection tabs


-------------------

The bot token that was pushed in a push is reset since py charm was retarded and did not push without the token even though in the python file it was set as TOKEN
